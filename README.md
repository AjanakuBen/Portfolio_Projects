**SALES OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS BY GOVERNMENT IN CANADA AND USA**

I used the **PACE strategy** document given by **Google Advanced Data Analytics** to record decisions and reflections to complete a project. The document was a guide to consider my responses and reflections at different stages of the data analytical process.

The overview of the project was to analyze the sales of different products sold by the government in Canada and the USA. This task was made simpler and more feasible by using the PACE strategy. I will highlight the actions I performed while using the PACE strategy:

The PLAN stage: I was able to consider my audience members, key milestones, and overall project goal. Also, what I am trying to solve or accomplish, resources, tools/software required to complete the project.

The ANALYZE stage: I cleaned the data (removed inconsistent entries, duplicates, misspellings, cleared formats, etc.) and explored it with #microsoftexcel. I then used a pivot table to show the total profits, total revenues (sales), and the total number of units sold for each product by the governments of the two countries.

The CONSTRUCT stage: A model is built and evaluated.

The EXECUTE stage: I was able to present and communicate my insights with the audience members and waited for their feedback.

The PACE strategy can be used as a resource when working on projects. This will aid my future projects. Thanks to #googledataanalytics #powerbi
